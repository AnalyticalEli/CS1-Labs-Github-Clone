//Linked Lists Notes

//Lists are better, than arrays as arrays are sequential

//A linked lists are based off of the idea of using pointers (aka addresses) to 
//point to the orginal rather than creating space for every single value.

//Use cases

//If you want to use and move things around use a list.

//If info/calculation is not needed to be moved then use an array.
