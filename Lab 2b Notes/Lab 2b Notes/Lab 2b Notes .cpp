	//declare string variable userName
	string userName;

	// Input string using cin
	//cout << "Please enter your full name: ";
	//getline(cin, userName);  //Correction we made was cin to getline because it is STRING
	//cout << "Your name is " << userName << " from the keyboard.\n\n" << endl;  // n\ is an enter space.



	//Rounding off numbers to the second decimal place


	//double x;  //Meaing 
	//cout << "Enter a decimal number:  ";
	//cin >> x;


	// set precision to two decimal places in the output stream (Essentially rounding off to 2 decimal places)
	//cout << fixed << setprecision(2);
	//cout << " Here is a (number) double rounded to two places: " << x << endl;
