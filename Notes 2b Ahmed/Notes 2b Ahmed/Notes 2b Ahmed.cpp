int main() {

    //INTEGER AND DOUBLE PORTION

	//double x; //Initialized means you assign a variable.

	//cout << "Enter a number: "; //It inputs a value
	//cin >> x;  //Cin = Extraction operator meaning it pulls a value out.

	//cout << x << endl;




	//CHARACTERS

	//char x; //A character

	//cout << "Enter a character: "; //It inputs a value
	//cin >> x;  //Cin = Extraction operator meaning it pulls a value out.

	//cout << x << " has ascii value " << int(x) << endl; //Casting meaning you turn the character into a variable.


	//STRINGS (Remember Cin does NOT WORK WITH STRINGS

	//string x;

	//cout << "Enter a string: ";
	//getline(cin, x); //The getline function is how we use the cin or pulling out a value with a string

	//cout << x << endl; //Casting meaning you turn the character into a variable.




	//Adding characters + strings

	//string x;
	//char y;

	//cout << "Enter a character: ";
	//cin >> y; 

	//cin.ignore(); //WE need to clear the cache which is what this line does

	//cout << "Enter a string: ";
	//getline(cin, x); //The getline function is how we use the cin or pulling out a value with a string

	//cout << x << " " << y << endl; //Casting meaning you turn the character into a variable.
